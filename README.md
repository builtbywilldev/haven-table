> *A simulation chamber for structured debate.*  
> Just layout for now. No models. No fluff. Pure frontend readiness.

### 🎯 Overview

**Haven Table** is a fully responsive, zero-storage debate arena built in React.  
Designed as a foundation for future AI-powered interactions, it currently focuses on precision layout, clean responsiveness, and a no-distraction interface.

---

### 🧱 Current Status

✅ Circular agent layout (desktop)  
✅ Top-row agent layout (mobile/tablet)  
✅ Start screen with lore + “Start Debate” button  
✅ Interjection input box for user simulation

❌ No agent dialogue yet  
❌ No real-time speaking logic  
❌ No backend or model connection

---

### 📱 Responsiveness

- On **desktop**, agents are arranged around a perfect responsive circle.
- On **mobile**, avatars shift to the top with reduced card size.
- **Interjection box** remains accessible on all screen sizes.

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- React 18  
- TypeScript  
- TailwindCSS  
- Fully client-side, zero dependencies

---

### 🚀 Roadmap

- 🧠 Add mock agent speaking logic (sequential prompts)  
- 🎭 Pulse animation when agent is “speaking”  
- 🔄 Integrate prompt simulation backend (lightweight, no cloud)  
- 📢 Add real interjection handling and logic routing

---

### 🧪 Concept

This isn’t just a UI — it’s the first step in building a **roundtable for logic-based agents** to speak, debate, and evolve.  
We’re not using OpenAI or Google out of the gate. We’re keeping it **free, client-based, and extensible**.
